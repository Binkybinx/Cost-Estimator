# Cost-Estimator

This project was an excellent opportunity to enhance CSS skills. Hereâ€™s a summary of what I learned:

- Gained hands-on experience with Flexbox for layout design and practiced alignment and distribution of items in flexible containers.
- Used linear gradients to explored various color stops and angles for dynamic backgrounds.
- Utilized :first-of-type and :last-of-type pseudo classes to target elements based on their position in the DOM.
- Used the ::before pseudo element to add decorative content.
- Worked with CSS transitions to create smooth scaling transformations.
